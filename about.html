    This project looks into the crime statistics of San Francisco, offering 
    a investigation of various criminal activities including prostitution, theft, robbery, vehicle theft, and many more. 
    In this projet we look into the world of drug and narcotic-related incidents in San Francisco. 
    Through blog posts, readers will be taken on a journey through the data, 
    presented in three distinct formats: a calendar plot, a map visualization, and an 
    interactive Bokeh graph. These diverse representation shows the data in different perspectives and 
    dives into the meaning and reasoning behind these vizualisations.
